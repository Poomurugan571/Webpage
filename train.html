			     <span class="name">Thermal Radiation</span>
				 <p>It is a transmission of energy from a heat source to the atmosphere in the form of an electromagnetic 
				 wave. The necessity of research in thermal radiation is very much important as we encounter radiation 
				 from suns nuclear fusion to rockets high-speed exhaust velocity.

				 <p>Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a numerical scheme that solves Navier–Stokes equations 
				 to answer real-world problems related to fluid flows. The usage is majorly on aerospace industry, 
				 weather environmental modeling, heat transfer, biomedical, engines, combustion.
